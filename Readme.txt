Programming Project-2: Multithreaded FTP Client and Server

a)  Group Name : Group 10
    Group Members : 
        1) Sahil Varma
        2) Abhishek Patwardhan

b) While executing "get" command, we are creating a downloads folder at client's root directory. So to access the received file please go to "/downloads" folder.

   Similarly while executing "put" command, we are creating a uploads folder at client's root directory. So to access the sent file please go to "/uploads" folder.

   To use the "put" command, the file to be sent to server should be present in the folder containing client and server code.

   To demonstrate this we are including a "test.txt" file along with the "Myftp" and "Myftpserver" files together in a single directory.
   
   NOTE : Downloads folder can be accessed by Server because the server and client code both are in same directory.
